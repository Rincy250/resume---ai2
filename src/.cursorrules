Database Structure
- Tables follow a relational structure with UUID primary keys and timestamps.

Tables:
1. profiles
   - Stores user's base information and resume components
   - Contains JSON fields for complex data (work_experience, education, skills, etc.)
   - One-to-one relationship with auth.users

2. jobs
   - Stores job listings with requirements and details
   - Public read access, user-specific write access
   - Contains salary_range as JSONB for flexible structure
   - Tracks application status and requirements

3. resumes
   - Stores both base and tailored resumes
   - Links to jobs table for tailored resumes
   - Contains same fields as profiles for resume content
   - Uses JSONB for section_order and section_configs
   - section_configs controls visibility and display of resume sections

Key Relationships:
- profiles.user_id → auth.users.id
- resumes.user_id → auth.users.id
- resumes.job_id → jobs.id (optional, for tailored resumes)
